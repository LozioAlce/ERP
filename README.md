# ERP
An implementation of the ERP method- Exact Redistributed Pseudoinverse Method 

This is a code implementation based on the paper of Johannes Stephan and Walter Fichter:
Title "Fast Exact Redistributed Pseudoinverse Method for Linear Actuation Systems"
DOI: 10.1109/TCST.2017.2765622

It solves the problem of control allocation when the request Ï„ may lead to some of the control inputs to be saturated.<br/>
It clips the saturated actuator to its maximum and redistributes the remain part of the request among the other actuators.
